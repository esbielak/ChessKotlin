# Building the project
### ./gradlew shadowJar
### java -jar build/libs/chess.jar // will show the usage

# progress
#### - Create a server which accepts two clients which are white and black (in that order)
#### - Basic message checking and server-client communication
#### - Basic chess logic (no castling and en passant and checking for checks yet)
# plans for the second part
#### - Finish the game so it can represent a standard
#### - Implement a queue system (+ ELO rating)
#### - [Maybe] Add persistent storage (save ELO, match database etc.)
